    <h1>Craft More!</h1>

	
    <section>
        <h2>What is craftmore?</h2><p>
            Craftmore was a minecraft server i started worked on very late in 2022, early 2023, the first iteration
            was planned to have some serverside content mods like CC-Polymer and tweaks to vanilla progression recipes
            to encourage "crafting more" hence the name, in order to get something out playable, 
            in the second iteration, i ended up just grabbing a few structure mods a few datapacks,
            that were all serverside only, and calling it a day, this is what i refer to as craftmore 1
            <br><br>
            The third iteration isn't really important, because i never really scrapped it as an idea i just needed to
            restart on the pack level, for skyblock, which is what iteration 4 is.
            <br><br>
            The fourth iteration was a skyblock server with a ton more serverside mods, and a semi custom dimension
            using the modern beta skylands generator and datapack portals, polyfactory and a few mods for logistics
            and tech loaded using polymc, the first version of the server with my mod alchemist, even used end remastered
            to make end progression harder, despite multiple people saying they'd play a skyblock, this server basically
            had 0 players, and what i refer to as craftmore 2.
            <br><br>
            This lead during the 20.4 minecraft update for me to start working on the fifth iteration, i didn't actually
            hard reset this one, it was actually the fourth iteration updated to 20.4 directly, i called it internally craftmore 2.5
            i never really finished it because of certain mods not updating, by the time they did, i was tired.
            <br><br>
            The sixth iteration was on 20.4, honestly there's not much to say about survival in it,
            it was basically a mix of iteration 2, 3 and 5, started bringing the content and progression into a survival world,
            i spent time refining the surrounding tech, migrating to a server proxy, making a server lobby mod so i could use a fabric lobby,
            making a creative plot server, and before i ended up burning out again the last thing i did was try to get a nucleoid skywars server running.
            <br><br>
            The seventh and current iteration is  for 21.0, the plan is the same as sixth iteration but this is a reset and there's a
            few more things i want to refine, and this is exactly what i'm making this site for

        <h2>What's the point of this site?</h2><p>
            Craftmore 2 felt like a disaster, like from a design point there didn't seem to be a problem, but i had trouble even getting people
            to try the server, and there's so much to do with Craftmore 3, if i can recruit any development help that would be useful, so this
            site will go over whats planned for the server.
            <br><br>
            Currently what is set in stone is all the updated to 21.0 polymer mods, and alchemist, new content incoming, 
            i'm also currently planning out and working on a server sided progression mod like BTWCE,
            i'd also like to make a polymer port of end remastered to help balance out the end.
            <br><br>
            Ofcourse any open source structure mods of decent quality that are released will be added much like Craftmore 1, everything
            will be released as a open source serverside modpack, specifically using JIJ to make it easy to install on server hosts.
            <br><br>
            What currently would be nice to have working but i don't have time to work on, is getting viaversion to work on lower than 1.19.4 clients
            with fabric networking api, some sort of viaversion compat with backport mods, more nucleoid stuff,
            prs to geyser to get polymer stuff working better for bedrock clients, plus a way
            to intercept bedrock clients on the same port for certain server proxies, some mod for polyfactory that is like what gregtech 2 was for ic2,
            and explicit compat for common client modpacks, instead of only whatever i use to play the server and release.

        <h2>I'm interested what should i do?</h2><p>
            Feel free to join the discord below for updates, as far as development most of the stuff needs to be contributed to public projects and not
            directly anyway, but if you want to work on any of the parts directly related to Craftmore like the progression mod or alchemist,
            the discord is the place to go, also if there's any mod you want to see, let me know, i'll add near any polymer port if it's not broken, i have no interest
            in running mods via polymc if it is ported though, not because it's bad, just because at this point polymer porting is easier to work with.
